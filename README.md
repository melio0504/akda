# Akda

In the Filipino language, _Akda_ can refer to a literary work, composition, or a piece of writing (like a book or poem). It can also refer to the author or the person who created such a written work.

I was inspired by the design of Goodreads and decided to create my own version with a look and feel that better fits my personal style. Akda is a simple and enjoyable website that lets you organize your books in a way that feels like viewing them on your very own bookshelf.
